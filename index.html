            <h1>Hi, I'm Gregor Holzmann.</h1>
            <p>
              I'm a Full-Stack Web Developer with a Graphic Design background
              interested in building engaging and user-focused experiences on
              the web.

          <p>
            Over the past 10+ years, I've built complex web applications with
            large user bases from the ground up. I do my best work at the
            intersection of design, business, and technical -- equally as
            comfortable with reviewing PRs for code quality as working with
            stakeholders and product owners to chart roadmaps and sprint plans.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout my agency career, I've worked with large enterprise
            companies like Comcast, AT&T, Kaiser Permanente, Brighthouse
            Financial, and Starbucks but also with mid-sized companies and
            startups.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm excited by constant learning and working towards making the web
            (and hopefully the world) a slightly better place as often as I can.
            I'm an obsessive puzzle-solver and turbo nerd. I like to examine
            complicated problems and find simple, elegant, and impactful
            solutions.

            <p>
              Brighthouse Financial needed modern digital tools to help
              financial advisors explain their life insurance and annuity
              products to their products. I worked alongside our UI/UX team to
              build a series of interactive data visualizations from scratch for
              a wide variety of their products and integrate them into their
              existing CMS for ease of maintenance and updating.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our team created intuitive tools targeting a "swivel screen"
              experience, in which an advisor could quickly input a handful of
              relative, generate easy to understand graphs and data-powered
              scenarios, and turn their screen around to show their clients just
              how their investments could really work for them.

              The EY (formerly Ernst & Young) Career Center is an internal
              career coaching service whose mission is to empower executives,
              within and beyond the firm. Their team needed a way to take the
              manual intake process into their white-glove service and
              transition to a digital experience to better serve their users and
              grow the program.

            <p>
              I worked with a small team of fullstack developers, UI/UX
              designers, and reasearchers to build a full-stack web application
              and API to help onboard. inform, and manage users while automating
              tasks to keep staff focused on the people. We also designed and
              constructed a bespoke DevOps solution to manage deployments and
              the infrastructure of an increasingly complex system with
              thousands of users.
